**Status:** Final

## 1. Introduction

### 1.1 Purpose
This Software Requirements Specification (SRS) document provides a comprehensive description of the technical requirements and architectural specifications for the WeddingBidders system. It defines the structural organization, naming conventions, and implementation standards that shall be followed throughout the development lifecycle.

### 1.2 Scope
This specification covers the backend (.NET-based) and frontend (Angular-based) components of the WeddingBidders system, including project structure, architectural patterns, coding conventions, and technology stack requirements.

### 1.3 Definitions, Acronyms, and Abbreviations
- **SRS**: Software Requirements Specification
- **API**: Application Programming Interface
- **DTO**: Data Transfer Object
- **EF**: Entity Framework
- **BEM**: Block Element Modifier (CSS naming methodology)
- **CORS**: Cross-Origin Resource Sharing
- **DDD**: Domain-Driven Design

### 1.4 Critical Architectural Constraints

The following architectural constraints are fundamental to the WeddingBidders system and SHALL NOT be violated under any circumstances:

1. **No Repository Pattern**: WeddingBidders SHALL NOT use the Repository pattern (IRepository or any repository abstraction) for data persistence. All data access SHALL be performed directly through the `IWeddingBiddersContext` interface.

2. **Services in Core (PREFERRED)**: Business logic and domain services SHALL be implemented in `WeddingBidders.Core` whenever possible. This is the **PREFERRED** architectural approach. Services should only be placed outside the Core project when they have explicit infrastructure dependencies.

3. **IWeddingBiddersContext as Persistence Surface**: The `IWeddingBiddersContext` interface is the single, unified persistence surface for the entire system. No additional abstraction layers SHALL be introduced.

---

## 2. System-Wide Requirements

### 2.1 Namespace Architecture
**REQ-SYS-001**: The system SHALL use flattened namespaces throughout all projects.

### 2.8 Frontend Theme and Colours
**REQ-SYS-011**: The frontend SHALL use the default Angular Material colours and theme. No new colours are to be introduced.

### 2.2 Backend Project Structure
**REQ-SYS-002**: The Backend SHALL consist of exactly three (3) projects:
- WeddingBidders.Core
- WeddingBidders.Infrastructure
- WeddingBidders.Api

### 2.3 Object Mapping
**REQ-SYS-003**: The system SHALL NOT use AutoMapper for object mapping.

**REQ-SYS-004**: The system SHALL create extension methods for Core models in the Api layer with a `ToDto` method that returns the mapped DTO.

### 2.4 Data Access Pattern
**REQ-SYS-005**: **CRITICAL** - The system SHALL NOT use the Repository pattern (IRepository or any repository abstraction) for persistence. This is a fundamental architectural constraint.

**REQ-SYS-006**: The system SHALL use the `IWeddingBiddersContext` interface directly for all data access operations. This interface provides the persistence surface for the entire system.

### 2.5 Identity Property Naming
**REQ-SYS-007**: The system SHALL include the name of the entity in identity properties.

**Example (Compliant):**
```
{Entity}Id
```

**Example (Non-Compliant):**
```
Id
```

### 2.6 File Organization
**REQ-SYS-008**: The system SHALL have exactly one (1) class, enum, record, or other type definition per file.

**REQ-SYS-009**: The system SHALL NOT have multiple object definitions in a single file.

### 2.7 Database Configuration
**REQ-SYS-010**: The system SHALL use SQL Server Express as the default database.

### 2.9 Implementation Simplicity
**REQ-SYS-012**: All implementations in the system SHALL be as simple as possible. Complex solutions SHALL be avoided in favor of straightforward, maintainable approaches that directly solve the problem at hand.

### 2.10 Structured Logging
**REQ-SYS-013**: **CRITICAL** - The system SHALL implement structured logging using Serilog across all backend areas with appropriate log levels and enrichment.

**REQ-SYS-014**: Information level SHALL log normal operations and API calls.

**REQ-SYS-015**: Warning level SHALL log validation failures and business rule violations.

**REQ-SYS-016**: Error level SHALL log all exceptions and external service failures with complete error details.

**REQ-SYS-017**: Critical level SHALL log system failures and data corruption issues.

**REQ-SYS-018**: Logs SHALL be enriched with CorrelationId, UserId, Timestamp, and relevant context identifiers (e.g., CustomerId, EventId, VenueId).

**REQ-SYS-019**: Environment information SHALL be included in logs.

**REQ-SYS-020**: Logs SHALL be centralized in Azure Log Analytics (production) or appropriate development targets.

**REQ-SYS-021**: Sensitive data (passwords, tokens, credit card information, personal identification numbers) SHALL NOT be logged.

**REQ-SYS-022**: All errors and exceptions SHALL be clearly logged with sufficient context to enable debugging and troubleshooting.

### 3.3 Persistence Interface
**REQ-CORE-004**: The Core project SHALL contain an interface named `IWeddingBiddersContext` with DbSet properties for each entity in the system. This interface represents the persistence surface. The implementation of this interface SHALL be located in the Infrastructure project.

**REQ-CORE-007**: **CRITICAL** - Backend services SHALL be implemented in `WeddingBidders.Core\Services` whenever possible. This is the **PREFERRED** approach. Business logic, domain services, and application services SHALL reside in the Core project's Services folder unless they have specific infrastructure dependencies that necessitate placement in the Infrastructure project.

**REQ-CORE-008**: When infrastructure dependencies require a service to be implemented outside the Core project, the service SHALL be placed in `WeddingBidders.Infrastructure\Services`.

**REQ-CORE-009**: The `WeddingBidders.Core\Services` folder SHALL contain service interfaces and classes with core business logic for the system.

**REQ-CORE-010**: Service implementations in `WeddingBidders.Core\Services` SHALL include but are not limited to: Authentication services, Email services, Azure AI Integration services, and other domain-specific business logic services.

### 3.5 Aggregate Folder Structure
**REQ-CORE-011**: Aggregate folders SHALL be named `WeddingBidders.Core\Model\{Aggregate}Aggregate`.

**REQ-CORE-012**: The aggregate folder `WeddingBidders.Core\Model\{Aggregate}Aggregate` SHALL contain all related Entities, Enums, Events, AggregateRoot, and other domain objects.

**REQ-CORE-013**: Each type within `WeddingBidders.Core\Model\{Aggregate}Aggregate` SHALL have its own subfolder (e.g., Events folder, Enums folder).
